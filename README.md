# 👋 Hi there, I'm Elena

Why This Project?
I chose to showcase the Freelance Project Tracker Pro because it demonstrates how ServiceNow can flexibly manage diverse workflows — not just for freelancers, but for any business that needs structured task management, client communication, budgeting, and invoicing in a unified system.

The app architecture is scalable:

A single form can serve different user groups, track distinct demographics, and feed powerful reporting dashboards for operational insight.

Modules like Feedback Collection illustrate how easy it is to expand the system — linking client experiences directly to project records without needing external platforms or complicated integrations.

This project highlights how ServiceNow can streamline operations across different business sizes and industries — using lean, connected system design.



A ServiceNow application for managing freelance projects, tasks, budgets, invoicing, and client communication — featuring calculated fields, dashboards, dynamic task tracking, and workflow-driven invoicing.
