## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi there, I'm Elena

🎯 I design and build real-world solutions using ServiceNow.

From internal request workflows to project and finance trackers, I'm passionate about streamlining processes, automating the repetitive, and making work more meaningful — for freelancers and enterprise teams alike.

## 🚧 What I'm building

🛠️ **Freelance Project Tracker**  
A modular ServiceNow app designed to help freelancers manage tasks, client projects, invoices, and payments — complete with dashboards, calculated fields, and custom logic.

🗣️ **Feedback Tracker**  
Lightweight internal app that captures user ratings and auto-classifies sentiment to trigger workflows and insights.

📦 More experiments coming soon...
